| serviceAccount.imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | The list of image pull secrets that should be added to the created ServiceAccount |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `nil` | Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount to be used by the pods. If not specified, but the "serviceAccount.create" flag is set, then the ServiceAccount name will be auto-generated, otherwise the 'default' ServiceAccount will be used. |

| volumes.sharedHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | When persistentVolumeClaim.create is false, then this value can be used to define a standard Kubernetes volume, which will be used for the shared-home volume. If not defined, then defaults to an emptyDir (i.e. unshared) volume. |
| volumes.sharedHome.mountPath | string | `"/var/atlassian/application-data/shared-home"` | Specifies the path in the Jira container to which the shared-home volume will be mounted. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Jira container's GID (2001), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `false` | If enabled, this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Jira can write to it. This is a workaround for a Kubernetes bug affecting NFS volumes: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260 |
